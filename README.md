## Features

### 1. Smart Interface Navigation

- Shows implementation count next to interface definitions
- Hover over interfaces to see:
  - Required methods
  - List of implementing types
  - File paths for each implementation
- Click on implementations to navigate directly to the code

### 2. Method Navigation

- Hover over methods to see which interfaces require them
- Click on interface names to navigate to their definitions
- Click on implementation types to navigate to their method definitions
